What are the contents of routing table


Destination Network: The network address or range of addresses the packet is intended for.   

Next Hop: The IP address of the next device (e.g., another router or a directly connected host) on the path to the destination network.   

Interface: The physical or virtual network interface through which the packet should be sent to reach the next hop.   

Metric: A value used to determine the cost or preference of a particular route. This can be based on distance, bandwidth, or other factors.   

Routing Protocol: The protocol used to learn the route information, such as OSPF, RIP, or BGP. Some routes may be statically configured instead.   


------------------------------------------

What are the different types of routing protocols?

Distance-vector (e.g., RIP)
Link-state (e.g., OSPF, IS-IS)
Path-vector (e.g., BGP)
Hybrid (e.g., EIGRP)

------------------------------------------

What is a Loopback Address?

A loopback address is a special IP address (in the range of 127.0.0.0/8 for IPv4 and ::1/128 for IPv6) that's used to send traffic back to the device itself. It acts like a virtual interface within the device, always available and active regardless of the status of any physical interfaces.   

The most commonly used loopback address is 127.0.0.1 (or ::1 in IPv6), often referred to as "localhost."   

Purpose in Routers:

Router Identification (Router ID): Routing protocols like OSPF and EIGRP use a unique Router ID to distinguish each router within a network. The loopback address is often used as a stable and reliable Router ID.   
Management Interface: Administrators can access the router's configuration and management interface via the loopback address, even if the physical interfaces are down or have IP addresses that might change.   
BGP Peering: In BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), the loopback address can be used as a stable identifier for establishing peering relationships between routers.   
Stability and Reliability: Since the loopback interface is always up, it provides a consistent point of reference for various protocols and services running on the router.

------------------------------------------

What are the different routing loop prevention mechanisms?

Split Horizon: Prevents a router from advertising a route back onto the interface it learned it from. Think of it like not telling someone a secret they already told you.
Poison Reverse: If a route becomes invalid, the router advertises it with an infinite metric (like a "poison pill"), signaling other routers to avoid it.
Hold-Down Timers: When a route fails, the router temporarily ignores updates for that route, giving it time to stabilize before accepting new information. It's like taking a time-out to cool down.
Maximum Hop Count: Limits the number of routers a packet can traverse before being discarded. This prevents packets from endlessly looping around the network like a lost traveler.

------------------------------------------

How Supernetting Works:

In supernetting, you take a group of consecutive network addresses and summarize them with a single network address and a shorter prefix length. This new network address, called the "supernet", encompasses the address ranges of all the original networks.   

Example:

Let's say you have the following four class C networks:

192.168.0.0/24
192.168.1.0/24
192.168.2.0/24
192.168.3.0/24
You can supernet these networks by summarizing them with the address 192.168.0.0/22. This single supernet address represents all four original networks and their 1024 total IP addresses.   

Why Supernet?

Simplified Routing: Supernetting reduces the number of entries in routing tables, making routing more efficient and faster.   
Conserved IP Addresses: By summarizing multiple networks into one, supernetting can help conserve IP addresses, especially in the case of IPv4, where address space is limited.   
Reduced Routing Overhead: With fewer routes to manage, routers can operate more efficiently, requiring less processing power and memory.

ARP


You're sitting at your laptop (let's say its IP address is 192.168.1.100) and you want to visit a website hosted on a server with the IP address 203.0.113.1. Your laptop is connected to a switch, which is then connected to a router that provides access to the internet.

The ARP Process:

ARP Request: Your laptop knows the IP address of the website's server, but it needs to know its MAC (Media Access Control) address to send data over the local network. So, your laptop sends an ARP request broadcast message out of all its network interfaces. This message essentially says, "Who has the IP address 203.0.113.1? Please tell me your MAC address."

ARP Response: The router, which is responsible for forwarding traffic to the internet, sees the ARP request. It recognizes the IP address 203.0.113.1 as belonging to a device on the internet, and it has its own MAC address associated with its external interface. The router sends an ARP response directly back to your laptop, saying, "I have 203.0.113.1, and my MAC address is XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX" (replace XX with the actual MAC address of the router's external interface).

ARP Cache Update: Your laptop receives the ARP response and stores this information in its ARP cache – a temporary table that maps IP addresses to MAC addresses. Now, your laptop knows both the IP address and the MAC address of the router's external interface.

Data Transmission: Your laptop can now encapsulate the data packet destined for the website's server with the router's MAC address in the Ethernet frame header. It sends this frame out to the switch.

Switching: The switch examines the destination MAC address in the frame and determines that it needs to forward the frame to the router. It sends the frame out of the appropriate port connected to the router.   

Routing: The router receives the frame, removes the Ethernet header, and examines the IP header. It determines that the packet needs to be forwarded to the internet, and it does so using its routing table and external interface.

Reverse arp

Reverse ARP (RARP) is a network protocol that performs the opposite function of ARP (Address Resolution Protocol). While ARP is used to find a device's MAC address given its IP address, RARP is used to determine a device's IP address given its MAC address.   

Why RARP was Used (Historically):

RARP was developed in the early days of computer networking to address a specific challenge: diskless workstations. These workstations didn't have hard drives to store their configuration, including their IP address. When they booted up, they only knew their MAC address (a unique hardware identifier). RARP allowed them to request their IP address from a server on the network.   

How RARP Worked:

RARP Request: The diskless workstation would broadcast a RARP request packet containing its MAC address.   
RARP Server: A RARP server on the network would maintain a table mapping MAC addresses to IP addresses.   
RARP Response: The RARP server would respond to the request with the corresponding IP address for the workstation.   

RARP has been largely replaced by more modern protocols like BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) and DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). These protocols not only provide IP address assignment but also offer additional configuration options like subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses.   

------------------------------------------

Autonomous System (AS):

Think of an AS as a large network or collection of networks under a single administrative domain. It's like a country with its own government and rules. Each AS has a unique number called an Autonomous System Number (ASN), used to identify it in the global internet. 

Interior routing protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF, EIGRP) are used within an autonomous system.
Exterior routing protocols (e.g., BGP) are used to exchange routing information between different autonomous systems.

As of July 2024, there are over 117,000 allocated Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) worldwide.

 This number is constantly growing as more networks are created and connected to the internet.

ping google.com

DNS Resolution: Your laptop determines the IP address of google.com by querying DNS servers.

ICMP Echo Request: Your laptop prepares an ICMP Echo Request packet containing a unique identifier and data payload.

IP Header Addition: The network layer adds the source and destination IP addresses to the packet.

MAC Header Addition: The data link layer adds the source and destination MAC addresses to the packet.

Local Network Transmission: The packet is sent from your laptop to the switch, which forwards it to the router.

Router Processing: The router examines the destination IP, consults its routing table, and performs NAT (if applicable) before forwarding the packet to the internet.

Internet Transit: The packet travels through your ISP's network and the internet backbone, guided by BGP routing.

Google Network: The packet reaches Google's network and is routed to the appropriate server.

ICMP Echo Reply: The server sends an ICMP Echo Reply packet back to your laptop.

Ping Result: Your laptop receives the reply, calculates the round-trip time, and displays the result.
