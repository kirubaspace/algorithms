1. Retry Pattern:

Problem: Transient failures (e.g., network blips, temporary service unavailability) can occur in cloud environments.
Solution: Implement retries with exponential backoff to handle these failures gracefully. This involves retrying failed requests with increasing delays between attempts, allowing the system to recover and preventing cascading failures.
2. Circuit Breaker Pattern:

Problem: Repeatedly calling a failing service can degrade performance and lead to resource exhaustion.
Solution: Introduce a "circuit breaker" that monitors service calls. If failures exceed a threshold, the circuit breaker trips, preventing further calls to the failing service. After a timeout period, the circuit breaker allows limited calls to check if the service has recovered.
3. Throttling Pattern:

Problem: Sudden spikes in traffic can overwhelm cloud resources.
Solution: Limit the rate of requests to prevent overload and ensure fair resource usage. This can be achieved through various techniques like rate limiting, token buckets, or leaky buckets.
4. Cache-Aside Pattern:

Problem: Frequent data retrieval from databases can be slow and expensive.
Solution: Store frequently accessed data in a cache (e.g., Redis, Memcached). When data is needed, check the cache first. If not found, retrieve it from the database and store it in the cache for future requests.
5. Queue-Based Load Leveling Pattern:

Problem: Fluctuating workloads can lead to uneven resource utilization and potential bottlenecks.
Solution: Introduce a queue between components to decouple them and handle varying workloads. This allows components to operate at different speeds, smoothing out traffic spikes and ensuring consistent performance.
6. Event Sourcing Pattern:

Problem: Traditional data storage with updates can lead to data loss and make it difficult to track changes over time.
Solution: Capture all changes to application state as a sequence of events. This provides an audit trail, enables replaying events to reconstruct past states, and supports building event-driven architectures.
7. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) Pattern:

Problem: Complex applications with both read and write operations can suffer from performance and scalability issues.
Solution: Separate read and write operations into different models. This allows for optimized data structures and query paths for each type of operation, improving performance and scalability.
