Docker Fundamentals
  
1. What is Docker and how does it differ from traditional virtualization?
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Unlike traditional virtualization, which runs full operating systems, 
Docker containers share the host OS kernel, making them more lightweight and efficient. Containers package an application and its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments.
  
2. What are the key components of Docker architecture?
The key components of Docker architecture are:
Docker Client: The command-line interface used to interact with Docker
Docker Daemon: The background service that manages Docker objects
Docker Registry: A repository for storing and distributing Docker images
Docker Objects: Images, containers, networks, and volumes
  
3. Explain the difference between a Docker image and a Docker container.
A Docker image is a read-only template containing instructions for creating a Docker container. It's like a snapshot of a container. 
  A container, on the other hand, is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete containers based on images.
    
Docker Commands and Usage
    
4. What are some essential Docker commands?
Essential Docker commands include:
docker build: Build an image from a Dockerfile
docker run: Create and start a container
docker pull: Download an image from a registry
docker push: Upload an image to a registry
docker ps: List running containers
docker stop: Stop a running container
docker rm: Remove a container
docker rmi: Remove an image
  
5. How do you create a Docker image?
To create a Docker image:
Write a Dockerfile with instructions for building the image
Use the docker build command, specifying the path to the Dockerfile
Optionally, tag the image using the -t flag
Example:
text
docker build -t myapp:1.0 .

  FROM <base_image>

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the necessary files from your host to the container
COPY . . 

# Install dependencies 
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Expose any ports your application needs to access
EXPOSE <port>

# Define the command to run when the container starts
CMD ["<command>"]
  
6. How can you view the logs of a running container?
Use the docker logs command followed by the container ID or name:
text
docker logs <container_id_or_name>
You can add flags like -f to follow the logs in real-time5.
Dockerfile and Image Management
  
7. What is a Dockerfile and what are its key instructions?
A Dockerfile is a text file containing instructions for building a Docker image. Key instructions include:
FROM: Specifies the base image
RUN: Executes commands in the container
COPY and ADD: Copy files from host to container
WORKDIR: Sets the working directory
EXPOSE: Declares the ports on which the container listens
CMD and ENTRYPOINT: Specifies the command to run when the container starts
  
8. What's the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT in a Dockerfile?
CMD provides default commands and/or parameters for the container. It can be easily overridden from the command line.
ENTRYPOINT configures the container to run as an executable. It's harder to override and is often used for containers that should always run the same command.
  
9. How can you reduce the size of a Docker image?
To reduce image size:
Use a smaller base image (e.g., Alpine Linux)
Minimize the number of layers by combining RUN commands
Remove unnecessary files and dependencies
Use multi-stage builds to separate build and runtime environments
Leverage .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files
Networking and Data Management
  
10. Explain Docker networking and its types.
Docker networking allows containers to communicate with each other and the outside world. Common network types include:
Bridge: The default network for containers on a single host
Host: Removes network isolation between container and host
Overlay: Enables communication between containers across multiple Docker hosts
Macvlan: Assigns a MAC address to a container, making it appear as a physical device
  
11. How do you persist data in Docker containers?
Data in Docker containers can be persisted using:
Volumes: Managed by Docker and stored outside the container filesystem
Bind mounts: Map a host directory to a container directory
tmpfs mounts: Store data in the host system's memory
Volumes are the preferred method for persisting data.
  
12. What is Docker Compose and how is it used?
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to configure application services, networks, and volumes. With a single command, 
  you can create and start all the services defined in the configuration.
Security and Best Practices
  
13. How can you secure Docker containers?
To secure Docker containers:

Linking (legacy feature)
Exposing ports
Containers on the same network can communicate using container names as hostnames.
  
17. What is a multi-stage build in Docker?
A multi-stage build uses multiple FROM statements in a Dockerfile. Each FROM instruction can use a different base, and each begins a new stage of the build. 
  This allows you to copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you don't need in the final image, thus reducing the overall image size.
  
18. How can you monitor Docker containers?
Docker containers can be monitored using:
Docker's built-in commands like docker stats
Third-party monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or DataDog
Container-native monitoring solutions

19. Explain the concept of Docker volumes and their types.
Docker volumes are the preferred way to persist data generated and used by Docker containers. Types of volumes include:
Named volumes: Managed by Docker and easy to back up or migrate
Anonymous volumes: Automatically created and removed when the container is deleted
Host volumes: Map a directory on the host to a directory in the container
  
20. What is Docker Content Trust?
Docker Content Trust (DCT) is a security feature that enables digital signing of image tags. It provides a way to verify the integrity and publisher of Docker images. When enabled, DCT ensures that you only pull and run trusted images2.
21. How does Docker handle environment variables?
Docker can handle environment variables in several ways:

ONBUILD: Triggers commands when the image is used as a base image
These hooks are crucial for proper container orchestration and management.
  
32. What is Docker layer caching and how can it optimize build time?
Docker layer caching is a mechanism where each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a new layer, and these layers can be reused in subsequent builds. To optimize:
Order Dockerfile instructions from least to most frequently changing
Combine related commands into a single RUN instruction
Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files
Place frequently changing instructions like COPY and ADD later in the Dockerfile
