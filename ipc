1. shared memory

// Writer

    // Receive data from the client
    recv(client_fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);
    printf("Data received from client: %s\n", buffer);

    // Send a response back
    send(client_fd, "Message from the server!\n", 25, 0); 

    // Close the sockets
    close(client_fd);
    close(server_fd);

    // Configure the address structure
    address.sin_family = AF_INET;
    address.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("127.0.0.1"); // Connect to localhost
    address.sin_port = htons(PORT); 

    // Connect to the server
    connect(client_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&address, sizeof(address)); 

    // Send data to the server
    send(client_fd, "Message from the client!\n", 25, 0); 

    // Receive a response from the server
    recv(client_fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);

=============

select


When to use select

The select system call is primarily used in scenarios where you need to monitor multiple sockets for activity. This is crucial when:

Handling Multiple Clients: A server needs to handle connections from multiple clients concurrently. You can't rely on blocking calls like read or recv since they would wait for only one client at a time.

Non-Blocking Operations: You want to perform non-blocking I/O on sockets. A socket that's not ready for reading or writing would normally cause read/write operations to block. select lets you check if data is available before attempting to read or write.

Timeouts: You want to implement timeouts when waiting for data to arrive at a socket.

Why use select

Here's why select is valuable in these situations:

Efficiency:  Instead of constantly checking each socket to see if it's ready (polling), select allows your process to sleep until one or more sockets become ready, reducing unnecessary CPU usage.

Scalability:   select helps manage many socket connections simultaneously, especially crucial for servers.

How select Works (Simplified)

File Descriptor Sets: You create sets of file descriptors (sockets in this case) that you want to monitor:

readfds: Sockets to monitor for read readiness (data available)
writefds: Sockets to monitor for write readiness (can send data)
exceptfds: Sockets to monitor for exceptions
Calling select: You call select(), providing the file descriptor sets and a timeout:

C
int select(int nfds, fd_set *readfds, fd_set *writefds, fd_set *exceptfds, struct timeval *timeout);
Use code with caution.
Return Value: select returns the total number of sockets that are ready. It also modifies the file descriptor sets to indicate specifically which sockets have activity.

Handling Ready Sockets:  You iterate through the modified sets to see which sockets are ready and perform the appropriate actions (read, write, or handle errors).

Caveat: While select is powerful, it has a limitation on the maximum number of file descriptors it can handle.  More modern solutions like epoll or kqueue often provide better scalability for applications handling a very large number of connections.

    // Create a socket
    client_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

    // Connect to the server
    connect(client_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&address, sizeof(address));

    listen(server_fd, MAX_CLIENTS);

            }
            max_fd = (client_fd > max_fd) ? client_fd : max_fd;
        }

        // Wait for activity on any of the sockets
        activity = select(max_fd + 1, &readfds, NULL, NULL, NULL);

        if (FD_ISSET(server_fd, &readfds)) {
            client_fd = accept(server_fd, NULL, NULL);
            // Add new client to the array of clients (implementation omitted for brevity)
            printf("New client connected.\n");
        }

        // Handle data from existing clients
        for (i = 0; i < MAX_CLIENTS; i++) {
